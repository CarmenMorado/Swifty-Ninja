# Swifty-Ninja
100 Days of Swift (Project 23) A Fruit Ninja-style game, where users must slice penguins for points and avoid slicing bombs. Within the course of this project, I became familiar with SKShapeNode, touchesEnded(), AVAudioPlayer, CaseIterable, and more. In addition, I completed the following challenges:


-Try removing the magic numbers in the createEnemy() method. Instead, define them as constant properties of your class, giving them useful names.


-Create a new, fast-moving type of enemy that awards the player bonus points if they hit it.


-Add a “Game over” sprite node to the game scene when the player loses all their lives.
